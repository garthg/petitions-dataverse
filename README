Usage
-----

To run an update:

1. If needed, parse Nicole's spreadsheet into the Dataverse spreadsheet.
   Use antislaverypetitions.py
   Run with --help or look at run_dev_tsv.sh for an example.

2. Run the Dataverse update.
   Invocations are captured in run_update*.sh.


Eventually this should be refactored with the following directories:
- One directory with all the code and dependencies
- One directory per archive project (e.g. antislaverypetitionsma, 
  nativeamerican, etc.) with all the data files, including the input data files
  as well as intermediate caches like local_id_to_id.
- One directory of all the other junk that's in this folder.
