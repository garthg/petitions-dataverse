Antislavery Petitions Massachusetts Dataverse

Author: Garth Griffin
Date: August 12, 2014


This project is concerned with batch upload of a historical dataset of
anti-slavery and anti-segregation petitions in Massachusetts [1] into a
Dataverse within the Harvard Dataverse Network [2]. The goal is to enable
scholars to explore and use this dataset. The project has been done in
collaboration with Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study [3] and with help 
from the Harvard Institute of Quantitative Social Science [4].

Code files:

- antislaverypetitions.py
  Main program for running the pipeline. Inputs and outputs are specified with
  command-line flags. Relies on the other Python files in this folder.
  
- dataversestudybuilder.py
  Module to facilitate the formatting of data for a Study in the Dataverse.
  Provides an interface to assemble the various fields defined by the Study 
  template and output the results as tabular data or as DDI XML files.

- tsvfile.py
  Module to facilitate reading and writing tab-delimited tabular data files.

- xmlformatter.py
  Module to facilitate the writing of DDI XML files suitable for batch import
  into the Dataverse. 

- run_xml.sh
  Script that runs the pipeline with a preset input and creates a zip archive
  of the output XML.

Example command:

python antislaverypetitions.py \
  --output_ddi_data_file=”petitions.xlsx” \
  --input_tsv=”petitions.tsv” \
  --output_ddi_dir=antislavery_petitions_2014-08-12 \
  --output_ddi_zip_file=antislavery_petitions_2014-08-12.zip 

This command may take several minutes to run. When finished, you should see 
that antislavery_petitions_2014-08-12 and antislavery_petitions_2014-08-12.zip
have been created.

The created zip file can be shared with Harvard IQSS [4] for batch import into
a Dataverse.

For details of command-line options, run:
python antislaverypetitions.py --help
