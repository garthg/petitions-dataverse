Petitions Dataverse

Author: Garth Griffin (http://garthgriffin.com)
Date: August 12, 2014

This project is concerned with batch upload of a historical dataset of
petitions (for example Anti-Slavery and Anti-Segreation Petitions [1]) into a 
Dataverse within the Harvard Dataverse Network [2].

The goal is to enable scholars to explore and use the datais dataset. The 
project has been done in collaboration with Radcliffe Institute for Advanced 
Study [3] and with help from the Harvard Institute of Quantitative Social 
Science [4].
